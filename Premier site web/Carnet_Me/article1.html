						<p>
							Some positions on the globe are spectacular; some animals live only on these spots. In the North Pacific Ocean, there are eight islands named Hawaï or Hawaii. These islands are paradise; you can see volcano, canyon, mountain and a lot more. I’ll show you how beautiful these islands are.<br />
						<br />
							Hawaii became part of the United States in 1959 and they built military and naval installations. Japan attacked these installations on Oahu with aircraft and submarine. These attack brought United States into World War II (2). In the present day, it’s a world of peace and beauty. These islands are principally liked because of the view from mountains, the clear blue seas, volcanoes, special sands, waterfalls and the sea life. If you prefer civilization, you will like Honolulu; it’s the biggest city of Hawaii. This one is situated on Oahu.<br /><br />

							Hawaii is special because of its geology. Most volcanoes, on the globe, are situated on the brink (intersection) of tectonic plates, but Hawaii is in the North of the Pacific Plate (not on the intersection of the plates). When geologist first saw that, they were surprised and they changed some theories. This place is perfect for surf because there is a magma source under these islands and it’s called a hotspot. It means that the ground moves (shake) more than the other places, that’s why there are more waves. Hawaii is the only states of the United States that:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>is not geographically located in North America</li>
							<li>grows coffee</li>
							<li>is completely surrounded by water</li>
							<li>is entirely an archipelago (chain of mountain)</li>
							<li>has a royal palace</li>
							<li>doesn’t have straight line in its state boundary</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Mountain is not the only thing spectacular on Hawaii, beach are awesome. It has 428 km of coast. Hawaii has a hundred different beaches.
							White sand is a common color for beaches on other islands that are not in Hawaii. Beaches on Hawaii are rare because of its four kind of sand: beach of black sand, beach of green sand, beach of white sand and beach called   “pepper and salt”, it’s a mix of white and black sand.<br /><br />

							Hawaii is the place for people who love nature. It’s principally based on tourism. You can do everything there: horse on mountain and near the sea, boat to see groove and stuff like that, see lava if you’re lucky, surf on big waves, kayak with a great view, dive with fish, golf (a perfect place to play golf), you can visit Pearl Harbor, you can taste cuisine. You can see canyon, shipwreck, waterfall and you can do four-wheels, plane and parachute. You cannot be bored of this perfect place. <br /><br />

							Oahu is the most populated island, it’s the result of two separated shield volcanoes and in the middle of it, there’s a valley. It’s the third largest island of Hawaii. It has 900,000 people and the density is 1,468/square miles or 567/km2. In 2006, there was an earthquake measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale, damages were surrounding $200 millions.<br /><br />

							Hawaii Island or Big Island is not populated because it has an active volcano on it. It’s composed of five mountains, during their eruption, they created the big island. Mauna Loa is the tallest volcano in the world, Kilauea is the tallest active volcano in the world and Mauna Kea (not the same of Mauna Loa) is the tallest mountain of the world by its base. It has an altitude of 9753 m from it base to the top and from the top, you can see 90% stars that can be seen from earth.<br /><br />
							If you or someone else travels there, you first need to know some tips. Hawaiians are very attached to their traditional values. Take care that you:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>respect nature and don’t throw your trash anywhere</li>
							<li>tradition said that surfing was invented there. So don’t make fun with those “legends of surfing”</li>
							<li>Always follow their icons, or “gods”, the Tikis</li>
							<li>Always be polite and say “hello” to Hawaiians (don’t confuse “hello” and “aloha”, which means “peace between two spirits”, peaceful formula)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Hawaii’s islands have 48 public high schools and 48 private high schools, in a total of 96 high schools. It has 29 colleges and universities but one is closed.<br /><br />
							Hawaii has 51.1% unaffiliated (irreligious) in religion of the population. The most popular religion is Christianity with 28.9% of the whole population. The second is Buddhism with 9% and the third is Judaism with 0.8%. If we regroup the other religions, it would have 10% of the population.<br /><br />

							Economy is based on tourism but there is much more: there is sandalwood, a plant to make oil and chess pieces, there is whaling, they hunt whale, there is sugarcane, pineapple (Dole Company), military and education.<br /><br />

							Oahu is the only island with federal highways, it’s due of the high population on this island. Each island has a public bus system. Most airlines are inter-island travel, the others airlines are from other states (intercontinental).<br /><br />

							In conclusion, this is a place to go in your life. You will be amazed of these islands. You could stay there one year and you wouldn’t be bored of this place. Maybe one day they will build bigger airline and it will be cheaper, but it’s worth it.
